# What's The Whitecat Create Agent?

The Whitecat Create Agent is a small piece of software that runs on your computer, and allows the communication beetween a [Lua RTOS device](https://github.com/whitecatboard/Lua-RTOS-ESP32) and [The Whitecat IDE](https://github.com/whitecatboard/whitecat-ide). This is needed because the IDE must perform many operations that needs to use your computer hardware, and the IDE is on the cloud!. The communication beetween the agent and the IDE is made using websockets
